                <strong>
                    <p>I've lived in Las Vegas with my wife for more than 20 years. Following college, we made the 
                    decision to escape the Utah snow and ended up in the sweltering Nevada desert.
                    In addition to the fact that there is <em>no state tax</em>, Las Vegas has a ton of fantastic 
                    restaurants, a ton of things to do, and that snow &#10052 is less than an hour away during winter, 
                    among other things.</p>

                    <p>
                        Like many Las Vegas residents, I worked for one of the properties on the Strip as a Financial
                        Planning Analyst for about a year and decided the hospitality industry in Las Vegas wasn't for 
                        me. Following my casion career, I was hired as a merchandising analyst at Zappos.com, an online 
                        softgoods retailer. Zappos is a fantastic company that values its customers, vendors, and 
                        employees. During my 12 years at Zappos, I began as a merchandising analyst and quickly advanced 
                        to merchandising planner. For about four years, I worked in merchandise planning, then as an 
                        inventory analyst, and finally as a business analyst. Unfortunately, I was laid off in February 
                        as a consequence of the economic downturn.

                <h1>Why Web Developer</h1>
                                <strong>
                    <P>I had some time with the ladioff to think about my next step in my career. When I first 
                    started college, I considered studying Computer Science and even took a few programming classes, 
                    but in the end, I chose a different path. So far, I've spent the majority of my career analyzing 
                    things or businesses; the layoff provided me with an opportunity to change careers. I wanted to 
                    build something, so I thought about software development. Also, my children are interested in 
                    coding, so I thought it might be a fun family activity we could do, and if I'm in the field, I 
                    could provide them with some guidance as they pursue the software development path.

                    </P>

                        I am extremely enthusiastic about two things: sports and food. Most of the sports I enjoyed, 
                        but soccer was my favorite. I enjoy watching, playing, and coaching soccer. In the past, I 
                        coached youth and club soccer. I've been coaching at the high school level for the past two 
                        years. I work as an assistant coach at Clark High School, assisting the head coach on varsity 
                        and overseeing the junior varsity. High school sports are a little different because school 
                        administrators believe that they are an extension of the classroom. As coaches, we have the 
                        responsibility to teach high school students about things other than sports, such as respect, 
                        communication, and work ethic. I enjoyed working with high school students and assisting them 
                        in preparing for life after high school.

                        Food is another one of my interests. I enjoy trying food from various cultures. I enjoy 
                        going out to new restaurants with my wife, as well as cooking and experimenting with new 
                        recipes. I've recently become obsessed with making desserts. Chocolate mousse cake and 
                        creme brulee are two of my favorite desserts to make.On the right side column, 
                        you can find a list of my favorite Las Vegas restaurants. 
                        Also, please share your city's favorite restaurant in the input box on the right.
